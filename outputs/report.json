It’s important to note that we did not open any of the packages — everything remained sealed.\n\nWe were told that returns are not allowed, even though we contacted them almost immediately after receiving the order. We asked to speak with a manager and were told that someone would get back to us… we are still waiting.\n\nBe aware that the customer service is extremely poor as well.",
